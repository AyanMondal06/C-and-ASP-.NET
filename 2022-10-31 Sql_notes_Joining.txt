Sql- Server:

1. What is Database.
Collection of data stored in table format.-It is a structure used to store data.


2. What is DBMS?-
It is a software which is used for creating and managing the database.



3. Types of Database?

1. Relational - In relational database datas are stored in table format.


2. Non-relational database- datas are stored in Key/value formats

eg: XML and JSON 


4. Types of Data Model- Way of organizing data.

1. Hierarchical Model- searching time is high.
In hierarchical model datas are arranged in tree like structure. 
					Course		Node

		Java			Dotnet			AWS

	st1		st2		st3	st4	



2. Network Model - Tree Like Structure.

Child Record will have Multiple parents.

3. Relational Model - datas are organized in table format.

student_datas -table relation

regid	name	dept	course  - columns/rows  attribute/tuples  field/record
101	aaa	cs	java
102	bbb	it	dotnet
103	ccc	cs	java
103	ddd	ec	dotnet

Degree//No of attributes present in the relation.

Cardinality//No. of tuples


Keys

What is Key?

student

Regid	Name	Branch	Email		Phone
101	Arun	CS	Arun@gmail.com	12345
102	Ruby	EC	Ruby@gmail.com	67891
103	Arun	EC	Arun@yahoo.co.in 23451
104	David 	CS	David@gmail.com	 Null

1. I Need Email of student Arun

2. I need Student Name in CS Branch.

Regid,Email are called Keys.
1. To retrieve the record uniquely
2.To establish relationship between 2 tables and also we can identify the 
relationship between 2 tables.

1. Candiate key.(Regid, Email,phone )(if an attribute or set of attributes
				used to uniquely identify the record)
2. Primary Key	 (It may be one of the candidate keys without Null Value)		
3. alternate key (The remaining keys(in candidate keys )which are not selected as primary key)
4. composite key.(if two or more than two attributes are combined to uniquely identify the record )(stuid+name)

5. foreign key.

student- database

stuid	name	branch
1	aaa	cs
2	bbb	ec
3	aaa	cs
1	bbb	cs

Activity Database(child)

activity	date		winner(foreign)

any		9999		s1


any		7777		s5



student database(Parent table)
primary key.

sid	name	branch	age

s1	aaa	cs      17
s2	bbb	ec	18
s3	ccc	cs	aa

1. Whenever you are entering a value in referring table (child) that value must be present in parent table or reffered table
2. whenever you delete or update records of parent table then all the references should be deleted/updated

Data Integrity.

Maintaining Correct and accurate data in database.

1. Domain integrity- It represents Data type of the attribute.(Not null, unique, check)
2. Entity integrity - uniquely identifying the record.It is maintained with the 
			help of primary key
3. Referential integrity.-Linking between two tables are done with the help of foreign key and it avoids data inconsistenty.

what is constraint.

it is a rule or condition.

1. not null- will not allow null values.
2. unique	- will not allow same/ duplicate values.
3. primary-
4. foreign constraint
5. check constraint.- to restrict input values.

These constraints can be divided into 2 types
1. column- level constraint if the constraints are defined immediately
after the column

create table Student_table(
Stid int Primary Key,
Stname varchar(20) Not Null,
Course varchar(20),
Age int check(Age>17 and Age<25)
);

2. table - level constraint. If Constraints are defined after the definitions of all columns are called table -level

create table Student_table(
Stid int,
Stname varchar(20) not null,
course varchar(20),
Age int
Primary key(Stid),
Check (Age>17 and Age<25));


Creating Foreign Key
---------------------

Department Database
-------------------
Deptid(Primary)		DeptName
101		Admin
102		Training
103		Marketing

create table Department_table(
Deptid int Primary Key,
Deptname	varchar(20)
);


Employee Database
Empid(Primary)	Deptid(Foreign Key)	Designation	Salary
1		101			HR		23000
2		102			Trainer		10000
3		102			Trainer		15000

create table Employee_table(
Empid int primary key,
deptid int references Department_table(deptid) on delete cascade,
designation varchar(20),
salary int);

Join -Retrieving record from Multiple tables based on common field.

1. Simple Join or inner join - will retrieve only matching records
2. left outer 
3. right outer
4. full outer join



student database

Stuid 	Stuname	    Course
101	AAA	    Java
102	BBB	    Dotnet
103	CCC          Java
104	DDD	     Java

Marktb
Stuid	Mark
101	87
102	89
107	72

select Student.Stuid,Stuname,Course,Mark from Student 
inner join marktb
on student.Stuid=Marktb.Stuid

101	AAA		Java	87
102	BBB	    	Dotnet  89

left join- will retrieve matching records from both tables as well as non
matching records from left table


select Student.Stuid,Stuname,Course,Mark from Student 
left join marktb
on student.Stuid=Marktb.Stuid

101	AAA	    Java	87
102	BBB	    Dotnet	89
103	CCC          Java	NULL
104	DDD	     Java	NULL

right join- will retrieve matching records from both tables as well as non
matching records from RIGHT table
	
101	AAA	    Java	87
102	BBB	    Dotnet	89
107	null	    null	72

Full Outer Join		
- will retrieve matching records between two tables and non matching records from both tables.

101	AAA	    Java	87
102	BBB	    Dotnet	89
103	CCC          Java	NULL
104	DDD	     Java	NULL
107	null	    null	72

create table Student(Stuid int primary key,
Stuname varchar(20),
Course varchar(20));

create table Mark(Stuid int primary key,
mark int);
